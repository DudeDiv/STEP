Problem Statement: Retrieve data to segment customers based on their total spending across
bookings and food purchases. The output should be structured to create an Excel pie chart
representing customer distribution by spending category (e.g., Low, Medium, High Spenders).

QUERY:
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.name,
    (COALESCE(SUM(b.total_cost), 0) + COALESCE(SUM(fo.total_cost), 0)) AS total_spending,
    CASE 
        WHEN (COALESCE(SUM(b.total_cost), 0) + COALESCE(SUM(fo.total_cost), 0)) < 100 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN (COALESCE(SUM(b.total_cost), 0) + COALESCE(SUM(fo.total_cost), 0)) BETWEEN 100 AND 500 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END AS spending_category

    User u

    Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id

    FoodOrder fo ON b.booking_id = fo.booking_id
